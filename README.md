Current Position

#Research associate (RA) in Earth Sciences Department, Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay.


Area of specialization
Detrital zircon and apatite fission track dating, Optically Stimulated Luminescence dating of sediments, topographic analysis, hydrological modeling, and field work. 


Research interest
I am fascinated by investigating different aspects of mountain building processes over a range of time scale from hundreds to several millions of years and over a range of length scale from ten to several kilometres.  I am especially interested in refining and developing numerical models that use multi-thermochronometric systems and topographic data to study the feedback between the surface and tectonic processes.
